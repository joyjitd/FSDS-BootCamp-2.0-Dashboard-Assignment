    "Inside the `nested()` function, the `nonlocal` keyword is used to indicate that the variable `X` is a nonlocal variable, which means it is not local to `nested()` but also not a global variable. The `nonlocal` keyword allows the `nested()` function to access and modify the variable `X` in its nearest enclosing scope, which in this case is the `func()` function.\n",
