    "The `send2trash` and `shutil` modules in Python provide different approaches for deleting files and directories. Here's a breakdown of their differences:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `send2trash` module:\n",
    "   - The `send2trash` module provides a safe way to delete files or directories by moving them to the operating system's trash or recycle bin instead of permanently deleting them.\n",
    "   - The `send2trash.send2trash()` function is used to send files or directories to the trash/recycle bin.\n",
    "   - Example: `send2trash.send2trash('path_to_file_or_directory')`\n",
    "   - By using `send2trash`, you can recover deleted files from the trash/recycle bin if needed.\n",
    "   - This module is useful when you want to delete files but still have the option to restore them later.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `shutil` module:\n",
    "   - The `shutil` module provides a variety of file and directory operations, including deletion.\n",
    "   - The `shutil.rmtree()` function is used to delete a directory and its contents recursively, including all files and subdirectories within it.\n",
    "   - Example: `shutil.rmtree('path_to_directory')`\n",
    "   - The `os.remove()` function from the `os` module, which `shutil` utilizes, is used to delete individual files.\n",
    "   - Example: `os.remove('path_to_file')`\n",
    "   - Unlike `send2trash`, the deletion performed by `shutil.rmtree()` and `os.remove()` is permanent and cannot be easily undone.\n",
    "   - The `shutil` module is suitable when you want to delete files or directories permanently without the option for recovery.\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize, the `send2trash` module provides a safe way to delete files and directories by moving them to the trash/recycle bin, allowing for easy restoration. On the other hand, the `shutil` module provides functions for permanent deletion of files and directories."
