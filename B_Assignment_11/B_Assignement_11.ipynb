    "Using logging messages instead of print() statements offers several advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Configurability**: With logging, you have more flexibility in configuring the logging behavior. You can define different log levels, control which log messages are displayed, and easily adjust the log output format. This configurability allows you to control the verbosity of your program's logging, making it easier to switch between different levels of detail based on your needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Granularity**: Logging provides different levels of severity (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL), allowing you to categorize and prioritize messages based on their importance. This granularity helps in distinguishing between different types of messages and focusing on the ones that require immediate attention.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Separation of Concerns**: Logging promotes separation of concerns by separating the act of generating log messages from the specific output destination. You can configure log handlers to send messages to various outputs such as files, the console, or even remote servers. This allows you to easily switch between different output destinations without modifying the logging calls in your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Runtime Control**: Logging allows you to change the logging behavior during runtime without modifying the code. You can dynamically adjust the logging level or redirect the log output without restarting the program. This can be especially helpful for debugging or troubleshooting in production environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Performance**: Compared to print() statements, logging can offer better performance, especially when the log output is disabled or redirected to a more efficient handler. By using log levels, you can selectively enable or disable logging based on the desired level of detail, reducing the overhead of generating log messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Integration with Libraries**: Many libraries and frameworks use logging for their internal messages. By using logging consistently in your code, you can seamlessly integrate with these libraries and capture their log messages along with your own, providing a unified logging experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, using logging messages provides more flexibility, control, and extensibility compared to print() statements, making it a better choice for structured and configurable logging in software development."

    "The Step Over, Step In, and Step Out buttons are commonly found in debuggers and are used to control the execution flow during debugging. Here's an overview of the differences between these three buttons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Step Over**: When you click the Step Over button, the debugger executes the current line of code and moves to the next line in the current function. If the current line contains a function call, the function is executed entirely without stepping into it. The debugger will pause at the next line after the function call is completed.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Essentially, Step Over allows you to execute the current line and move to the next line, treating function calls as a single step.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Step In**: The Step In button is used to step into a function call. When you click Step In, the debugger will move to the next line of code, even if it is inside a function. If the current line contains a function call, the debugger will enter the called function and pause at the first line inside that function.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Step In allows you to dive into the details of the called function and debug it line by line.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Step Out**: Step Out is used to step out of the current function. It allows you to quickly exit the current function being debugged and continue executing the remaining lines of the calling function. When you click Step Out, the debugger will run the remaining lines of the current function and pause at the line where the function was called.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Step Out is useful when you want to quickly return to the caller and skip debugging the remaining lines of the current function.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, Step Over executes the current line and moves to the next line, Step In allows you to enter and debug a called function line by line, and Step Out allows you to quickly exit the current function and continue debugging from the calling function. These buttons provide control over the flow of execution during debugging, helping you analyze the behavior of your code step by step."

    "2. **Exception**: If an exception occurs during the program's execution and is not caught, the debugger will stop at the point where the exception is raised. This allows you to examine the program's state and the traceback to understand the cause of the exception.\n",
